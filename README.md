# TheatreCMS3

The purpose of this repository is for presentation of the first of two live projects of a two-week duration completed during the duration of my time whilst attending [The Tech 
Academy Software Developer Bootcamp](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/codingbootcamps), based in Portland, Oregon and is a subsidiary of Â© Prosper Consulting Inc.

## Introduction

A local theater company in Portland, Oregon needed a new website, howevr, they did not have any technical staff for building of their new website.  Prior to the project, they had been using Word Press sites.  The goal of the project was to build something new that looks professional and unique and is easy to maintain or change.  My role for this project was to share in development of the Rental area of the new website.  The end product for the website would be a MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#.

Stepping into a project that was already underway was (in my view) about as "real-world" of an experience as I can imagine to prepare me for my future roles in software developement.  

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities I implemented.  Please note, during the time that this project was ongoing, I experienced some personal challenges that impacted my ability to complete as many project stories as I had intended upon inception of the project.  However, I have attempted to provide perspective as it concerns the manner in which I approach and execute relative to the work that I produce. 

### Back End Stories
* Create Entity Model for Rental Request and CRUD Pages

#### Create Entity Model for Rental Request and CRUD Pages


### Front End Storie
* Sign-in Page Styling
* Rental Request Accordion

#### Sign-in Page Styling: Story consisted of styling page the displays names of developers that worked on the project, doing so without changing, adding or removing HTML, leaving <p> tags 'as is' (no class adds or changes), optional addition of classes or ids for surrounding container that contains the devs names, incorporation of compound selectors to select the <p> tags, addition of CSS to create the Site.css file, setting of the width of all <p> tags to a specific width so that they are all uniform, and ensuring that <p> tags do not wrap, but rather implement an ellipses CSS property when text overflows.

#### Rental Request Accordion: Revise scaffolded index page to an accordion, ensuring that clicking on the horizonal bar reveals a panl with additional details about the rental request whilst pushing other rental requests further down the page, ensuring that each rental request in the accordion meets specific aethetic requirements, and incorporating a feature that displays "time remaining" and "time till start", and finally displaying the start and end times for the rental.


Finally, utilizing a DevOps project management methodologies, incorporating Scrum task tracking, and Agile Boards was such a different experience from other projects I have participated that were not of a software development nature as it concerns.  I am astounded at the the effectiveness of these methods as it concerns efficiency, task management, accuracy and so on.  They are extremely powerful and I am very excited to venture into an industry that takes such a methodical and contrived approach to the work that I will do in the coming years.
