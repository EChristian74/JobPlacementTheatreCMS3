The purpose of this repository is for presentation of the first of two live projects of a two-week duration completed during the duration of my time whilst attending [The Tech

## Introduction

A local theater company in Portland, Oregon needed a new website, howevr, they did not have any technical staff for building of their new website.  Prior to the project, they had been using Word Press sites.  The goal of the project was to build something new that looks professional and unique and is easy to maintain or change.  My role for this project was to share in development of the Rental area of the new website.  The end product for the website would be a MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#.

Stepping into a project that was already underway was (in my view) about as "real-world" of an experience as I can imagine to prepare me for my future roles in software developement.  

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities I implemented.  Please note, during the time that this project was ongoing, I experienced some personal challenges that impacted my ability to complete as many project stories as I had intended upon inception of the project.  However, I have attempted to provide perspective as it concerns the manner in which I approach and execute relative to the work that I produce. 


### Back End Stories
* Create Entity Model for Rental Request and CRUD Pages

#### Create Entity Model for Rental Request and CRUD Pages: Story consisted of creation of an entity model for rental request and CRUD pages so that requests can be saved to the database, creation of rental request a model schema, update of database to create a table, verification that table has been created in database, and scaffolding of the CRUD pages within Areas > Rental to create the Index, Create, Details, and Delete pages.  Requirement also included not creating a new DbContext (use existing), use of existing Layout.cstml in main project, and ensuring not to select option to async controller methods.


### Front End Stories
* Sign-In Page Styling
* Rental Request Index Page Accordion

#### Sign-In Page Styling: Story consisted of styling of the developers signin page that worked on the project, howeving doing so without changing, adding or removing HTML, ensuring that paragraph tags are not revised or new ones created.  However, classes or ids could be added to the surrounding name container and use of compound selector was allowed.  Finally, add CSS styling was added for paragraph tags to a specific width for uniformity, and CSS properties we added to ensure that any text overflow would be handled utilizing CSS properties and ellipses.
  
#### Rental Request Index Page Accordion: Story consisted of revision of an existing rental request table scaffolded index page to an accordion.  Accordion header bar was to reveal a panel with additional details for rental requests whilst pushing other rental requests further down the page.  Furthermore, rental request details were to meet specific aesthetic requirements and was to include a bar indicating "time remaining" and "time till start."  Finally, a "start time" and "end time" were to be present as well.

## Additional Thoughts

Finally, utilizing a DevOps project management methodologies, incorporating Scrum task tracking, and Agile Boards was such a different experience from other projects I have participated that were not of a software development nature as it concerns.  I am astounded at the the effectiveness of these methods as it concerns efficiency, task management, accuracy and so on.  They are extremely powerful and I am very excited to venture into an industry that takes such a methodical and contrived approach to the work that I will do in the coming years.
